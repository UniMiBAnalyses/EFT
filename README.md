# EFT

Once the Madgraph generation is finished (following instructions in D6EFTStudies/generation)
and the root ntuples have been produced (following instructions in D5EFTStudies/analysis),
starting from the root files fits can be tested.

## EFT/DatacardCreator

The first step is the creation of datacards, to be used by the CMS Combine tool.
The code produces datacards to be used, the corresponding root file containing the histograms and some plots.


## EFT/Fit

This package contains instructions on how to install the Combine package.
