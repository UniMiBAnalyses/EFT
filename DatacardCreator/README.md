# create datacards for the Combine tool

## datacard\_creator
It reads .cfg file, file\_W.cfg is an example. From the .cfg it reads which .root file contains the SM, 
interference and BSM terms, cuts and also which variable to analyse.

It creates a datacard.txt for each variable specified and also a .root which will be passed to Combine.

It also creates different type of plots(stack, log and shape), putting the three distributions together.

## datacard\_creator\_2

The code has been mostly taken from ```datacard_creator.cpp```. 
Fragmented in subfunctions implemented in ```dcutils.*```,
reads a config file containing the list of variables to be studied,
the selections to be applied,
the files to be read and some detailed configuration parameters
  * files have to be produced with ```read_03.cpp```, 
    which is where variables are built. 
    If a new variable is needed,
    for the time being a new run of ```read_03.cpp``` is required.
  * for each variable as an input in the cfg file,   
    ```datacard_creator_2.cpp``` produces a pair of files:
    a root file containing histograms and a datacard for Combine.

## datacard\_twoOp\_creator
It is used to study two operators together creating, as datacard\_creator both datacard files and plots.

## range_vs_kineticvar
Reads a .txt containing the confidence interval's bounds found with Combine. It sorts the list of variables and plots the width of the C.I.
